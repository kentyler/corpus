  "Flow runner — executes sequences of transforms and effects.

   A flow is a vector of steps. Each step is a map with :step key:

   :transform — apply a pure state transform via dispatch!
     {:step :transform :name :set-loading :args [true]}
     {:step :transform :name :set-objects :args-fn (fn [ctx] [:tables (:data ctx)])}

   :effect — execute an async effect, store result in context
     {:step :effect :descriptor {:type :http ...} :as :result}

   :branch — conditional execution based on context
     {:step :branch :test (fn [ctx] boolean) :then [steps] :else [steps]}

   :do — escape hatch for complex logic (fn receives ctx, returns ctx or channel of ctx)
     {:step :do :fn (fn [ctx] ...)}

   The runner maintains a context map that accumulates effect results.
   Transforms read/write app-state via the atom. Effects produce data
   stored in the context under their :as key (or :last-result)."
